All Stock Analysis using Arrays and for Loops
  
  After refactoring the existing code, it will be easier for Steve to research a lot more stocks than the original 12 he had because in the new code we do not have to list the tickers, and all he will have to do as he adds more information is update the tickerIndex size along with all other array sizes to match. This update will save him a lot of time as he is trying to find his parents the stock withe the highest return.
